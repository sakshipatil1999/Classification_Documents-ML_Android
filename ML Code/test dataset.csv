Before overt proteinuria develops, albumin excretion increases in those diabetic patients who are destined to develop diabetic nephropathy. Therapeutic maneuvers (eg, aggressive blood pressure maintenance, particularly with angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors; aggressive blood sugar control; and possibly decreased protein intake) can significantly delay, or possibly prevent, development of nephropathy.  3.The preferred specimen is a 24-hour collection, but a random collection is acceptable.  4. Correcting aloumin for creatinine excretion rates has similar discriminatory value with respect to diabetic renal involvement. The albumin:creatinine ratio from a random urine specimen is also considered a valid screening tool.  5. Microalbuminuria is a marker of generalized vascular disease and is associated with stroke and heart disease.  6. Due to biologic variability, positive results should be confirmed by a second, first-moming random or 24-hour timed urine specimen.  7. Urine collected during menses may contain excess albumin and collection during this time should be avoided.  8. Heavy exercise may increase albumin excretion and should be avoided during collection. Normal values apply to a nonexercised state.  Reference : Mayo Medical Laboratories, 2018 Interpretive Handbook.

It also has important, emerging roles in immune function and cancer  prevention. Vitamin D compounds in the body are exogenously derived by dietary means; from plants as 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 (ergocaliferal or calciferol) or from animal products as 25-hydroxyvitamin D3  (cholecalciferol or calcidiol).  Vitamin D may also be endogenously derived by conversion of 7-dinydrocholesterol to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in the skin upon ultraviolet exposure.  The total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-VitD) level (the sum of 25-OH-vitamin D2 and 25-OH-vitamin D3) is the appropriate indicator of vitamin D body stores.  Patients with renal failure can have very high 25-OH-VitD levels without any signs of toxicity, as renal conversion to the active hormone 1,25-OH-VitD is impaired or absent.  Kindly corelate clinically, with supplementation history & repeat with fresh sample if necessary.

Hypocaloemia is due to the absence or impaired function of the parathyroid glands or impaired vitamin-D synthesis. Qhronic renal failure is also frequently assodated with hypocalcemia due to decreased vitamin-D synthesis as well as hyperphasphatemia and skeletal resistance to the action of parathyroid hormone (PTH).  4.

Increased HbA1C values may be found in patients with polycythemia or post splenectomy patients. Patients with Homozygous forms of rare variant Hb(CC,SS,EE,SC) HbAtc can not be quantitated as there is no HbA. In such circumstances glycemic control can be monitored using plasma glucose levels or serum Fructosamine.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a biomarker of inflammation. Plasma CRP concentrations increase rapidly and dramatically (100-fold or more) in response to tissue injury or inflammation.  2. High-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) is more precise than standard CRP when measuring baseline (i.e. normal) concentrations and enables a measure of chronic inflammation. It is recommended for cardiovascular risk assessment. Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease and hs-CRP has been endorsed by multiple guidelines as a biomarker of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk.  Low cardiovascular risk : < 2.0 mg/L High cardiovascular risk : >/= 2.0 mg/L Acute inflammation :> 10.0 mg/L  3. A single test for high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) may not reflect an individual patient's basal hs-CRP Repeat measurement may be required to firmly establish an individual's basal hs-CRP concentration.  The lowest of the measurements should be used as the predictive value.  Reference : Mayo Medical Laboratories, 2018 Interpretive Handbook.     Dr.(Mrs.) Manisha S. Patwardh: Page 7 of 17 AD, DEB eg.

Ferritin is found chiefly in the cytoplasm of cells of the reticuloendothelial system and is a constituent of normal human serum. Generally the concentration of ferritin is directly proportional to the total iron stores in the body. There is a significant positive correlation between age and serum ferritin concentrations in females, but not in males. Patients with iron deficiency anemia have serum ferritin concentration approximately one-tenth of normal while patients with iron overload (hemochromatosis, hemosiderosis) have serum ferritin concentrations much higher than normal. Ferritin is a positive acute phase reactant in both adults and children, whereby chronic inflammation  results in a disproportionate increase in ferritin in relation to iron reserves. Elevated ferritin is also observed in acute and chronic liver disease, chronic renal failure, and in some types of neoplastic disease.     Dr.(Mrs.) Manisha S.

Method : Nephelometry / Immunoturbidimetry        Clinical Information : 1. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a biomarker of inflammation. Plasma CRP concentrations increase rapidly and dramatically (100-fold or more) in response to tissue injury or inflammation.  2. High-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) is more precise than standard CRP when measuring baseline (i.e. normal) concentrations and enables a measure of chronic inflammation. It is recommended for cardiovascular risk assessment. Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease and hs-CRP has been endorsed by multiple guidelines as a biomarker of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk.  Low cardiovascular risk: < 2.0 mg/L High cardiovascular risk : >/= 2.0 mg/L Acute inflammation :> 10.0 mg/L  3. A single test for high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) may not reflect an individual patient's basal hs-CRP level. Repeat measurement may be required to firmly establish an individual's basal hs-CRP concentration.  The lowest of the measurements should be used as the predictive value.

ESR is markedly elevated in monodonal gammopathy stich as multiple myeloma, in severe polyclonal hyperglobulinemia due  to inflammatory disease, and in hyperfibrinogenemia. 2. Moderate elevations are common in active inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritls, chronic infections, collagen disease and neoplastic disease  3. ESR has little diagnostic value in these disorders but can be useful in monitoring disease activity.  4. Useful in the diagnos and in monitoring polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis.  5. Moderate increase is seen in pregnancy (beginning at the 10th to 12th week) and returns to normal about 1 month  postpartum . 6. Red cells with an abnormal or irregular shape, such as sickle cells or spherocytes, hinder rouleaux formation and  tower the ESR.

Method : Nephelometry / Immunoturbidimetry          Clinical Information : 1. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a biomarker of inflammation. Plasma CRP concentrations increase rapidly and dramatically (100-fold or more) in response to tissue injury or inflammation.  2. High-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) is more precise than standard CRP when measuring baseline (i.e. normal) concentrations and enables a measure of chronic inflammation. It is recommended for cardiovascular risk assessment. Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease and hs-CRP has been endorsed by multiple guidelines as a biomarker of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk.  Low cardiovascular risk: < 2.0 mg/L High cardiovascular risk : >/= 2.0 mg/L Acute inflammation :> 10.0 mg/L  3. A single test for high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) may not reflect an individual patient's basal hs-CRP level. Repeat measurement may be required to firmly establish an individual's basal hs-CRP concentration.  The lowest of the measurements should be used as the predictive value.
